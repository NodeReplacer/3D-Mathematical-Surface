In the eyes of a sine graph, which is a wave, travelling along the x axis will change the y value. We can project this change onto a cube but only send the y-value change to the cube's y-position. This will make the cube move up an down. Getting multiple cubes and setting them up appropriately will make a wave motion. This can be interfere with itself in a variety of ways to create multiple visually interesting motions.
