In the eyes of a sine graph, which is a wave, travelling along the x axis will change the y value. We can project this change in position onto a single cube but only send the y-value to the cube's y-position. This will make the cube move up and down. Getting multiple cubes and setting them up appropriately will make a wave motion. (As if each individual cube was a voxel) 

This can be made to interfere with itself in a variety of ways to create multiple visually interesting motions and not just a simple wave.
